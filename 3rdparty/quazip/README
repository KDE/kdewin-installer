QuaZIP is the C++ wrapper for the Gilles Vollant's ZIP/UNZIP package
using Trolltech's Qt library.

It contains original ZIP/UNZIP package C code and therefore depends on
zlib library.

Also, it depends on Qt 4.

To comile it on UNIX dialect:

$ cd quazip
$ qmake
$ make

You must make sure that:
* You have Qt 4 properly and fully installed (including tools and
  headers, not just library)
* "qmake" command runs Qt 4's qmake, not some other version (you'll have
  to type full path to qmake otherwise).

To install compiled static library, just type:

$ make install

By default, it installs in /usr/local, but you may change it using

$ qmake PREFIX=/wherever/you/whant/to/install

You do not have to compile and install QuaZIP to use it. You can just
(and sometimes it may be the best way) add QuaZIP's source files to your
project and use them.

See doc/html or, if you do not have a browser, quazip/*.h and
quazip/doc/* files for the more detailed documentation.
