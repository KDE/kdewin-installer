TODO

1 installer 
  1 common 
    2 add source documentation (when api is mostly stable)
    2 complete package descriptor format (separate build/runtime requirements) 
    3 add mode for installing from local package directory
      Q: how to restore the categories ? 
      A: May be by storing packages into category dirs 
    4 remove empty directories when removing packages 
    5 test creating start menu entries support
    6 add support to create/remove start menu entries for a specific package, which is required for the installer 
    7 how to handle packages which requires administrative access like vcredist and others (which package exactly ?)
    8 some msi files are started without displaying a gui like perl. This should be fixed

  2 command line installer 
    3 test
  
  3 gui 
    1 add reinstall package support -> currently by using a remove and install by hand 
    2 add return to the package selector package after installing package 
    3 if remote config is not available only display installed packages
    4 only display firefox proxy option is firefox is installed 
    5 center checkboxes in package selector page -> not possible yet, see comment in source
    6 implement end user package selector page 
    7 create a msi package which installs the kde installer and adds an entry in the software control panel 

2 packager
    1 exlude *d.exe in strip 
    2 exclude .#* *.rej *.orig files in src package
    3 add *d.exe files to lib package 
    4 don't exclude exe's ending with d from bin package when a debug version using dd is present, only the debug version should go into lib 

3 configer 
    1 add support to config.txt for using flat directory structures (= only one directory), which is required for sourceforge mirrors
      this requires also extending config.txt parser 
 
4 packaging system 
    - runtime dependencies should be separated from the build requirement. perl for example is a build requirement of kdebase. 

Ideas
=====
    - internationalisation support
        - KDE based -> by using pot file (requires currently cygwin and gettext-devel package)
          $ (cd kdesupport/kdewin-installer; XGETTEXT=xgettext QTONLY=yes /c/downloads/kdesvn/trunk/l10n-kde4/scripts/extract-messages.sh)
        - or qt based (tr files)
