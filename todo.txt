TODO
====

1 common
  1 add tool documentation
  2 complete package descriptor format (separate build/runtime requirements) 

2 installer 
  1 common 
    1 before installing check if all dependencies of installed packages are also installed and select them too for installing when not 
    2 complete sha1 checksum support 
    3 add mode for installing from local package directory
    4 remove empty directories when removing packages 
    5 how to handle packages which requires administrative access like vcredist and others (which package exactly ?)
        -> running those application as admin user ? 
    6 some msi files are started without displaying a gui like perl. This should be fixed
    7 PackageList::readFromDirectory() - add package hash file autodetection

  2 command line installer 
  
  3 gui 
    1 add reinstall package support -> currently by using a remove and install by hand 
    2 add return to the package selector package after installing package 
    4 only display firefox proxy option is firefox is installed 
    5 center checkboxes in package selector page -> not possible yet, see comment in source

3 packager (update todos) 
    1 exlude *d.exe in strip 
    2 exclude .#* *.rej *.orig files in src package
    3 add *d.exe files to lib package 
    4 don't exclude exe's ending with d from bin package when a debug version using dd is present, only the debug version should go into lib 

4 configer (development suspended for now)
    1 add support to config.txt for using flat directory structures (= only one directory), which is required for sourceforge mirrors
      this requires also extending config.txt parser 
 
5 packaging system 
    1 runtime dependencies should be separated from the build requirement. perl for example is a build requirement of kdebase. 

Ideas
=====
    - internationalisation support
        - KDE based -> by using pot file (requires currently cygwin and gettext-devel package)
          $ (cd kdesupport/kdewin-installer; XGETTEXT=xgettext QTONLY=yes /c/downloads/kdesvn/trunk/l10n-kde4/scripts/extract-messages.sh)
        - or qt based (tr files) (initial support available)
