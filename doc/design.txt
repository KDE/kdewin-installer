Design notes for KDE installer
==============================

The idea of the kde installer is to have a qt command line and/or gui application, 
which makes it possible to download and install packages required for KDE on windows. 

Currently the following packages are known to be required: 

- dbus binary packages
- qt binary package 
- gnuwin32 or win32libs runtime package
- kdewin32 binary packages (may be containing gnuwin32 or win32libs packages) 
- kde binary and source packages
- c++ compiler packages 
- additional libraries for example boost, db for kdevelop
- additional tools from elsewhere for example perl, python and others 
- packages from other sources

Features
--------

The design allows to use different download types (for example from a sourceforge 
project or a web site generated by the Apache ModIndex module and other)  
 and/or different download mirrors.

The command line tool works currently well for gnuwin32 related packages. 
Adding additional installer for example to install 7zip packages from the 
win32libs download area is very easy. Using an different download strategy is also easy.

The gui installer is in a very early state and not functional.


Design
------


The installer uses a main config file located on a well known server to detect which 
packages and/or sites have packages to install.  A sample format is shown below

On each start of the installer this file inspected and the package lists are downloaded. 

Then the user can select packages to install using the gui version or the command line version.
After confirmation the relateds packages are downloaded and installed or updated.
